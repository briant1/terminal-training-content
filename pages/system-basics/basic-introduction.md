## Introduction

The **terminal** is a program that provides a graphical interface between the shell and you, the user.  When you launch the terminal it will run a shell. The main job of the shell is to start other programs. 

In OSX and other operating systems, the default shell is **bash**.  Bash is one of the most popular command-line shells. Open up your terminal and type ‘echo $SHELL’ and it most likely will print ‘/bin/bash’.

Bash was written by Brian Fox in 1989. The shell’s name is an acronym for Bourne-again shell, a pun on the name of the Bourne shell that it replaces and on the term “born again.” 

The Windows counterpart to bash is **PowerShell** that is, until [windows 10's anniversary update](https://www.howtogeek.com/248177/whats-new-in-windows-10s-anniversary-update/). This brought the Windows Subsystem for Linux which lets developers run Linux environments. Window's update makes **bash** even more popular.

The vast majority of commands taught in Terminal Training are using **bash** with most of the screen shots and videos from OSX. If you have any questions about other shells or differences between operating systems, reach out at any time via chat.
