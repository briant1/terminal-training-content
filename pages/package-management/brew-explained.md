Homebrew installs packages into the /usr/local directory. Why?

Why does Homebrew prefer I install to /usr/local?
* Itâ€™s easier
* /usr/local/bin is already in your PATH.
* Apple has left this directory for us. Which means there is no /usr/local directory by default, so there is no need to worry about messing up existing tools.\[[1](https://docs.brew.sh/FAQ.html)\]
