## Brew Cask

Cask is an extension for homebrew or *brew* that eliminates the need to download, then drag and drop applications to install them and it runs from the termainl!

To install:
<pre class='brush: bash;'>
brew tap caskroom/cask
</pre>

Then you can type in something like: 
<pre class='brush: bash;'>
brew cask install atom
</pre>

This installs the text editor [atom](https://atom.io/). You'll notice cask will install all dependencies as well.
